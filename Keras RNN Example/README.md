## Explanation

The code is a simple example of how to use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict future stock prices using historical data. Let's go through the code step by step.

First, the necessary libraries are imported, including pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, scikit-learn for data preprocessing, matplotlib for visualization, and Keras for building and training the RNN.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, LSTM
```
Next, a stock symbol and the path to its historical data CSV file are defined. In this example, the stock is Apple (AAPL).

```python
symbol = 'AAPL'
csv_path = f'Keras RNN Example/data/{symbol}.csv'
```

The historical data is loaded from the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame, and the Close column is extracted.


```
data = pd.read_csv(csv_path, index_col='Date', parse_dates=True)
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data['Close'].values.reshape(-1, 1))
```

The data is then scaled using the MinMaxScaler from scikit-learn to normalize it between 0 and 1.


```python
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data['Close'].values.reshape(-1, 1))
```
Next, the training data and labels are defined. A look-back period of 60 days is used, meaning the model will be trained to predict the next day's closing price based on the previous 60 days of closing prices.


```python
look_back = 60
train_data = []
labels = []
for i in range(look_back, len(scaled_data)):
    train_data.append(scaled_data[i-look_back:i, 0])
    labels.append(scaled_data[i, 0])
train_data, labels = np.array(train_data), np.array(labels)
```
The data is reshaped into a format suitable for input into the LSTM layer of the RNN.


```python
train_data = np.reshape(train_data, (train_data.shape[0], train_data.shape[1], 1))
```

The LSTM model is defined using the Sequential class from Keras. Two LSTM layers with 50 units each are used, followed by a Dense layer with one unit, which will output the predicted closing price.


```python
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(train_data.shape[1], 1)))
model.add(LSTM(units=50))
model.add(Dense(units=1))
```
The model is then compiled and trained using the compiled loss function and optimizer.


```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
model.fit(train_data, labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```
After training the model, the last 60 days of the scaled data are used as test data. The predicted prices for the next 30 days are then generated using the trained model.


```python
test_data = scaled_data[-look_back:]
test_data = np.reshape(test_data, (1, test_data.shape[0], 1))
predicted_prices = []
for i in range(30):
    prediction = model.predict(test_data)
    predicted_prices.append(prediction[0, 0])
    test_data = np.append(test_data[:, 1:, :], prediction.reshape(1, 1, -1), axis=1)
```

The predicted prices are then inverse scaled back to their original format using the MinMaxScaler.

```python
predicted_prices = scaler.inverse_transform(np.array(predicted_prices).reshape(-1, 1))
```

Once the model is trained, the code uses it to predict future stock prices. It takes the last 60 days of the scaled data as the initial test data, and uses the trained model to predict the next day's closing price. The predicted price is added to the test data, and the oldest day is removed, so that the test data is always 60 days long. This process is repeated for 30 days to generate predictions for the next 30 days.

The predicted prices are then reverse-scaled using the MinMaxScaler to obtain the actual predicted prices in dollars. Finally, the actual and predicted prices for the last 30 days are plotted to visualize the accuracy of the predictions.

In summary, this code implements a recurrent neural network using LSTM layers to predict future stock prices based on historical data. It uses a sliding window approach to prepare the data for training, and scales the data using a MinMaxScaler. The model is compiled and trained using the training data, and then used to generate predictions for the next 30 days. The predicted prices are reverse-scaled to obtain actual dollar values, and plotted against the actual prices to visualize the accuracy of the predictions.
